# Pendle Finance Yield Trading

Pendle Finance allows you to separate interest bearing assets such as Lido's stETH and Ethena's sUSDe into two components: a principal token (PT) with a fixed interest rate and a yield token (YT) with a variable interest rate. You can then trade the PT and YT separately, for example with the purpose of betting on the expected yield from the underlying asset.

## Test with the local agent

I've built a simple agent called `ask-pendle` to test the integration. To run it, you need to configure .env:

```bash
cd projects/pendle
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
# insert test wallet private key into .env
# insert OpenAI or DeepSeek key into .env
```

and then you can ask questions directly:

```bash
pnpm ask-pendle "What can I do on Pendle?"
pnpm ask-pendle "LP 1000 USDC into pool sUSDCe on Ethereum"
pnpm ask-pendle "Remove half of my liquidity from pool sUSDCe to ETH on Ethereum"
```

Options:

- `--debug-llm`: Show the actual LLM responses
- `--debug-tools`: Show the output of every tool call
